[Course information](https://cadmo.ethz.ch/education/lectures/HS21/algolab/index.html) | [ETH Course catalogue](https://www.vvz.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lang=en&semkez=2021W&ansicht=ALLE&lerneinheitId=147899)

The repository contains solutions for the problems in Autumn semester 2021.

## Structure

* `intro_cpp` contains C++ Introduction Exercises
* `week_XX` contains the problem set for the week
* `potw_XX` contains the Problem of the Week (but there is no PotW 1)
